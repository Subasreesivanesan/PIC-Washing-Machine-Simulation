This project simulates the control logic of a washing machine using a PIC microcontroller.
It focuses on embedded fundamentals such as GPIO handling, LCD interfacing, state-based
logic, and safety mechanisms like door detection.

All peripherals are simulated using PicsimLab. In a real implementation, switches can be
replaced with sensors and delays with timer interrupts.
